# Advanced Machine Learning - CPSC 8420

Welcome to the GitHub repository for **Advanced Machine Learning (CPSC 8420)**, taught by Dr. Kai Liu in the Spring of 2022 at Clemson University. This repository contains assignments and projects that explore the mathematical foundations and practical implementations of major machine-learning approaches.

## Course Overview

In this repository, you will find assignments and projects that demonstrate the fundamental mathematical derivations of machine learning tools. Our approach emphasizes understanding by implementing basic mathematical concepts from scratch, rather than relying on functions from public packages. This hands-on method fosters a deeper comprehension of machine learning principles.

## Repository Contents

- **Assignments:** Solutions to course assignments showcasing mathematical derivations and practical implementations.
- **Projects:** Practical applications of machine learning techniques learned throughout the course.
- **Code Examples:** Implementation of basic machine learning algorithms from first principles.
- **Documentation:** Detailed explanations and theoretical background of implemented algorithms.

## Learning Objectives

By exploring this repository, you will:
- Gain a thorough understanding of the mathematical foundations underlying modern machine learning.
- Develop practical skills in implementing machine learning algorithms from scratch.
- Apply theoretical knowledge to real-world problems through course projects.
